\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Effective Resistances}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Effective Resistances are a metric.
\item They're metrics of negative type, a fact useful for computing them quickly.
(Spielman Srivastava).
\item They measure expected commute time, the probability that any given
edge is contained in a random spanning tree, and more.
\item Question: What more can we say about them, with respect to
well-studied metric theory?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Negative Type Metrics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Negative type metrics are known to contain: L2, L1, Hypermetrics,
  ...
\item Theory of Isometric Embeddings is of independent interest.
\item Known that $l_2 \subset l_1 \subset HyperMetrics \subset NegType$.
\item Question: Where does effective resistance fit in? 
\item Conjecture: Effective Resistance is contained inside $l_1$.
\item Theorem: Effective Resistances are contained in Hypermetrics, are
not contained in $l_2$, and $l_2$ does not contain the effective
resistance distance.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hypermetrics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Polygonal inequalities satisfied.
\item Mostly of mathematical interest.
\item A full classification of Hypermetrics is known (also: l1 metrics,
    negative type metrics.)
\end{enumerate}
